<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Representative Mike Kelly (PA-03) released the following report today, to be e-mailed to his constituents throughout Pennsylvania’s Third Congressional District, to serve as a year-in-review of his office’s legislative achievements and constituent relations throughout 2015.</p>
<p>Dear Constituent:</p>
<p>As we embark on another new year, I would first like to thank you for the honor and privilege of serving you in the U.S. House of Representatives, or as I prefer to call it, <em>the People’s House</em>.

</ul><p><strong>Providing Tax Relief &amp; Restoring Common Sense to the Tax Code</strong></p>
<p>As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, working to keep taxes low and accountable for hardworking Western Pennsylvania families and businesses is a daily responsibility of mine. This involves constant review of our nation’s overly complex tax code to make it fairer and simpler for all taxpayers while preparing for eventual comprehensive tax reform. While long-term reform remains our top goal, last year my colleagues and I were able to successfully implement a number of very important improvements to the tax code that will help grow our economy and, just as importantly, prevent unfair tax increases in the future.</p>
<p>Just last month, as the year came to an end, the House passed <a href="https://kelly.house.gov/press-release/house-passes-major-legislation-prevent-tax-increases"><em>the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act</em></a> (H.R. 2029), which was supported by a bipartisan majority of 318-109 and ultimately signed into law by President Obama. This legislation extends or makes permanent dozens of already-existing tax relief provisions while also halting the job-killing Medical Device Tax within the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) for two full years. It represents a serious achievement for hardworking taxpayers, small businesses, and our entire nation’s economy. Not only does it protect millions of families and job creators from higher taxes but also helps restore both certainty and clarity to our outdated tax code. Additionally, it changes federal law to better protect Americans from further abuse at the hands of the IRS.</p>
<p>I was especially glad that this package contained <a href="https://kelly.house.gov/press-release/house-passes-major-legislation-prevent-tax-increases">nine major bills that I personally introduced</a> and fought to include for the sake of creating jobs, fostering economic growth, and protecting hard-earned taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>At the beginning of last year, my House colleagues and I passed two other significant tax relief bills that would save families and small businesses millions of dollars every year: <a href="https://kelly.house.gov/press-release/rep-kelly-supports-repeal-federal-death-tax"><em>the Death Tax Repeal Act</em></a> (H.R. 1105) and <a href="https://www.gop.gov/bill/h-r-636-americas-small-business-tax-relief-act-of-2015/"><em>the America’s Small Business Tax Relief Act</em></a> (H.R. 636). The former would permanently repeal the federal estate tax, also known as the “death tax,” which is an unfair 40 percent tax on an individual’s transfer of assets to his or her children at the time of his or her death. The latter would enable taxpayers to expense up to $500,000 of investments in new equipment and property for their businesses per year. Each pro-growth bill has been sent to the Senate for approval, and I look forward to seeing them advance in the new year.</p>
<p>Also last winter, after President Obama used his State of the Union address to shockingly propose taxing the 529 college savings plans used by millions of middle-income families, I proudly co-sponsored <a href="https://kelly.house.gov/press-release/rep-kelly-commends-passage-bipartisan-bill-strengthen-college-savings-plans">H.R. 529</a> to save and strengthen these plans. The 529 plans make it easier for millions of households to send their children to college, which encourages more students to pursue higher education, which in turn helps more young adults achieve the careers of their dreams. Fortunately, by the time this bipartisan bill was passed in the House by an overwhelming vote of 401-20, President Obama had abandoned his extremely unpopular proposal altogether.<span>                                                 </span></p>
<p><strong>Unleashing American Energy &amp; Dominating the Global Economy</strong></p>
<p>Since taking office, I have argued that America is ready to realize a massive economic renaissance if only the federal government would get out of the way and let our nation of builders rise and thrive. Nowhere is this more true than in our nation’s energy sector.</p>
<p>Early last year, the new Congress wasted no time passing <a href="https://kelly.house.gov/press-release/rep-kelly-calls-president-obama-support-keystone-xl-pipeline">legislation to finally approve the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline</a>, a commonsense, long-anticipated project that would create 42,000 American jobs, boost our economy, and strengthen our allies. It easily passed the House and the Senate with bipartisan support. It earned the backing of prominent business and labor organizations alike. Public opinion polls showed consistent majorities of Americans in each political party all agreeing that it was finally time to say “Yes!” to Keystone. Unfortunately, despite the project’s national popularity, President Obama said “No!” and vetoed the bill when it got to his desk. If nothing else, the action confirmed that while Congress is interested in getting things done for the good of all Americans, this president would shamefully rather pander to his political base.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, our energy agenda continued and by mid-summer, I had introduced <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/898"><em>the Energy Production Fairness Act</em></a> (H.R. 898) and re-introduced <a href="https://kelly.house.gov/press-release/rep-kelly-re-introduces-coal-country-protection-act"><em>the Coal Country Protection Act</em></a> (H.R. 2637), among others. The latter piece, like its version from 2014, was a response to President’s Obama war on coal and the EPA’s controversial regulatory plan for the nation’s coal-fired power plants. The bill would halt any new EPA regulations from affecting power plants until four specific economy-protecting requirements are fully met. The former bill, which lowers taxes on propane usage, will reduce heating bills for countless families and seniors in the Third District and help local energy providers create more jobs. It is bipartisan, it is commonsense, and, after being signed by President Obama in December, it is now law.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the year, the House passed <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/press-release/banner-week-committee%E2%80%99s-energy-efforts">a series of bills</a> to modernize outdated energy laws, boost drinking water for rural regions of our country, and keep electricity affordable and reliable for Western Pennsylvanians and all Americans. At the same time, we passed <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/press-release/house-votes-improve-safety4drivers-and-bolster-american-energy-security">a long-term highway bill</a> that will improve driver safety and bolster the nation’s energy security. This legislation was signed into law last month, along with <a href="https://www.speaker.gov/general/lifting-oil-export-ban-numbers">a bill to end the 40-year ban on American crude oil exports</a>—a major victory for our energy workers, manufacturers, consumers, and allies.</p>
<p>In order to not just participate in but dominate the global economy while creating good-paying jobs here at home, the United States has no choice but to reduce its regulatory burden on businesses large and small. That is why the House passed multiple bills over the past year to sensibly roll-back Washington’s onerous red tape on America’s job creators, including: <a href="https://www.gop.gov/bill/h-r-185-regulatory-accountability-act-of-2015/"><em>the Regulatory Accountability Act</em></a> (H.R. 185), <a href="https://www.gop.gov/bill/h-r-37-promoting-job-creation-and-reducing-small-business-burdens-act/"><em>the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act</em></a> (H.R. 37), and <a href="https://www.gop.gov/bill/h-r-427-regulations-from-the-executive-in-need-of-scrutiny-act-of-2015/"><em>the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act</em></a> (H.R. 427). Each bill would restore commonsense to our regulatory policies while the REINS Act in particular would amend the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to require congressional approval of every new major agency regulation before they can go into effect.</p>
<p>In addition to energy expansion and regulatory reduction, our nation’s economic revival depends on us reaching beyond our borders to allow American manufactures to sell their exceptional products to new markets and more customers. For this reason, I helped lead the charge in passing <a href="https://kelly.house.gov/press-release/rep-kelly-praises-house-passage-trade-promotion-authority"><em>the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015</em></a> (H.R. 2146), which enacted <a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/TPA.TwoPager.pdf">Trade Promotion Authority</a> (TPA), providing Congress with unprecedented oversight power to guarantee the strongest possible trade deals for American workers and businesses while enforcing total transparency throughout every future trade negotiation process. I also stood behind <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/22/text">legislation</a> to reform and reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a program that helps sustain thousands of jobs in the Third District.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping America Safe &amp; Preventing a Nuclear Iran</strong></p>
<p>The very first responsibility of the United States federal government is to protect the lives of its citizens—period. Unlike our savage enemies, from the Islamic State to the Islamic Republic of Iran, we cherish human life and pass laws to defend it.</p>
<p>Even 14 years after 9/11, the threat of radical Islamic terrorism persists and in fact has grown. It is evil, it is deadly, and it is actively waging war on not just America but the entire West and our way of life. It will not rest until its militant ideology dominates the world. What we felt on 9/11 and what France felt in November were glimpses of the terror this enemy is committed to spreading. Whether we like or not, we are still at war – a war that was declared on us long ago – and it will not go away simply because we tire of it. This war must be decisively fought and won.</p>
<p>When faced with fatal threats to our people, our government has a constitutional duty to carry out whatever action may be necessary to defend the homeland and keep Americans safe. Over the course of the past year, I joined my congressional colleagues in assembling and enacting critical legislation to properly wage the war on terrorism, support our troops on the battlefield, and keep the United States in a position of maximum global strength.</p>
<p>In June, the House passed <a href="https://www.gop.gov/bill/h-r-2685-department-of-defense-appropriations-act-2016/"><em>the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2016</em></a> (H.R. 2685), which increases funding for our Armed Forces by $24.4 billion compared to last year; $800 million above what President Obama requested. In May and again in November, we passed <a href="https://www.gop.gov/bill/s-1356-national-defense-authorization-act-ndaa-for-fiscal-year-2016-as-amended/"><em>the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2016</em></a> (H.R. 1735, S. 1356), which ensures that our troops have all the resources required to successfully defend the homeland and achieve their missions abroad while granting them a well-earned pay raise. It authorizes lethal assistance to forces fighting Russian-backed rebels in Ukraine, training and equipment for moderate anti-government fighters in Syria, and funding to help Iraqi security forces fight ISIS. It also explicitly prohibits the president from closing the Guantanamo Bay detention center and transferring its detainees to the American mainland. By year’s end, after a worthy struggle with the White House, each of these bills was signed into law.</p>
<p>After the coordinated attack by ISIS in Paris, it was clearer than ever that the group’s evolving threat demanded a renewed strategy for fighting back. I have long argued that our war cannot be an air war alone, and that ground forces must also be summoned to not only win back territory from ISIS but to then preserve it. On the home front, I argued that we should indefinitely suspend the Obama administration's Syrian refugee acceptance program. The United States has long been the world's most charitable and compassionate nation, but with the world on fire and the nature of our enemy in mind, we must simultaneously be realistic and vigilant.</p>
<p>In November, I co-signed <a href="https://stivers.house.gov/uploadedfiles/11.18.15_rep_stivers_letter_to_potus_syria-iraq_refugees.pdf">a joint letter to President Obama</a> – with more than 100 members of Congress – insisting that he immediately halt the admission of refugees from Syria and Iraq onto American soil until an effective vetting and monitoring system is established. I also co-signed <a href="/sites/kelly.house.gov/files/documents/11-17-2015%20Letter%20to%20Wolf%20on%20Syrian%20Refugees.pdf">a joint letter to Governor Tom Wolf</a> – with 9 other members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation – urging him to indefinitely suspend Pennsylvania's participation in the refugee program until verifiable and robust mechanisms can properly screen all participants for potential security risks. That same week, the House passed <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4038"><em>the American Security Against Foreign Enemies (SAFE) Act</em></a> (H.R. 4038) – which would halt the acceptance of designated refugees – by a bipartisan veto-proof majority.</p>
<p>Early last month, I voted for <a href="https://homeland.house.gov/visa-waiver-program/"><em>the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act</em></a> (H.R. 158), which amends the Immigration and Nationality Act and strengthens the Visa Waiver Program to help prevent foreign terrorists from entering the United States. It also maintains the program's ability to facilitate legitimate foreign business travel and tourism to our country. It overwhelmingly passed by the House by 407-19 and was ultimately signed into law.</p>
<p>Throughout the Obama administration’s long and tedious negotiations with Iran over the future of its nuclear program, I warned and reminded my colleagues that the Islamic Republic is not our moral or geopolitical equal but rather an untrustworthy terror state still committed to the advance of radicalism and the annihilation of Israel. In May, I supported the passage of <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1191?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22hr1191%5C%22%22%5D%7D&amp;resultIndex=1"><em>the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act</em></a> (H.R. 1191), which ensured that Congress would have the ability to review and formally approve or disapprove the nuclear agreement with Iran before the president could waive any sanctions previously imposed by Congress.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/world/full-text-of-the-iran-nuclear-deal/1651/">the text of the deal</a> was finally unveiled last summer, I saw it as a dangerous mistake of historic proportions. It failed to achieve the paramount mission of permanently ending Iran’s nuclear ambitions while instead leaving the Islamic Republic newly emboldened, wrongly legitimized, and ominously free to continue its deadly sponsorship of international terrorism. The Iranians clearly exploited President Obama’s desperation for a deal by extracting concession after concession and in return got rewarded with tens of billions of dollars in sanctions relief—much of which is guaranteed to be funneled to terrorist groups and causes throughout the world.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I joined most of Congress in voting against <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3461?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22hr3461%5C%22%22%5D%7D&amp;resultIndex=1">legislation to approve the agreement</a>, and even for <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3460?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22hr3460%5C%22%22%5D%7D&amp;resultIndex=1">a bill to halt the deal</a> until the next president is inaugurated. However, our current president still had enough votes in the Senate to ignore our opposition – and that of most Americans – to get the deal signed and implemented.</p>
<p>With the recent reports of illegal ballistic missile tests being conducted by Iran, it appears that many of our fears are already being proved real. For the sake of safety at home and peace abroad, this deal must still be abandoned.</p>
<p><strong>Tackling Our Debt &amp; Holding the Line on Spending</strong></p>
<p>With our national debt quickly approaching an unprecedented $19 trillion, the need to rein-in Washington’s out-of-control spending addiction has never been so urgent. If Western Pennsylvania families are expected to live within their means, then so should Washington.</p>
<p>Last March, I was very proud to support H. Con. Res. 27, a budget resolution for fiscal year 2016 produced by the House Budget Committee also known as <a href="https://budget.house.gov/fy2016/summaryandkeyfacts.htm"><em>A Balanced Budget for a Stronger America</em></a>. The plan would have balanced the federal budget in less than 10 years and reduced our national debt without raising a single penny in new taxes. It would have also fully repealed Obamacare – including all of the law’s expensive taxes, regulations, and mandates – while implementing commonsense tax reform to help grow our economy. It stood in incredible contrast to President Obama’s reckless budget proposal which included $2.1 trillion in new taxes, $8.5 trillion in more debt, and never balanced—ever, all while leaving our nation’s promises to seniors on the road to bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Two months later, both the House and the Senate passed a bicameral budget agreement for fiscal year 2016 (also known as <a href="https://gop.gov/bill/conference-report-to-s-con-res-11-establishing-the-budget-for-the-united-states-government-for-fiscal-year-2016-and-setting-forth-appropriate-budgetary-levels-for-fiscal-years-2017-through-2025/">the Conference Report to S. Con. Res. 11</a>). It marked the first time since 2001 that both chambers of Congress agreed to a plan that would balance the federal budget in less than 10 years – without raising any taxes – while fully funding our military, preserving Medicare, and putting our country on a sustainable path to real economic growth.</p>
<p>History was truly made last spring when Congress overwhelmingly passed <a href="https://kelly.house.gov/press-release/rep-kelly-supports-bipartisan-senior-fix-reform-strengthen-medicare"><em>the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015</em></a> (H.R. 2), which repealed the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula and replaced it with an improved, fiscally responsible formula that returns stability to Medicare physician payments. (SGR was first enacted in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to control Medicare spending on physician services. However, SGR policy flaws compelled Congress to override the formula-driven cuts for more than a decade. In fact, since 2003, Congress had spent nearly $170 billion in short-term patches to avoid these unsustainable cuts.) Our legislation strengthens Medicare’s reliability, secures seniors’ access to their doctors, and saves taxpayers nearly $2.9 trillion over the long term. It was signed into law in April and represented the first piece of major entitlement reform to be enacted in two decades.</p>
<p>Sometimes tackling Washington’s spending problem requires not just proactive legislation but the simple ability to stand up and say “Enough is enough” to a bad idea. That occurred just last month when the House considered <a href="https://dailysignal.com/2015/12/16/whats-wrong-with-the-massive-omnibus-spending-bill/">a $1.15 trillion “omnibus” bill</a> to set the government’s budget through the end of fiscal year 2016. The legislation called for $50 billion in new government spending, added to our nation’s deficit and debt, and funded too many wasteful policies and programs that, among other things, put our security and our economy at great risk. Furthermore, it came without critical provisions to protect American tax dollars from misuse by President Obama, including a lack of provisions that would've protected the jobs and benefits of America’s coal sector from being ravaged by the EPA.</p>
<p>I will never forget that I was sent to Washington to help put an end to our government's out-of-control spending habit that is unfairly piling trillions of dollars of debt on our children and grandchildren's backs. This omnibus bill pushed federal spending in the wrong direction and reversed much of the progress that my colleagues and I have made over the last five years. For all of these reasons, I chose to vote against this bill.</p>
<p><strong>Defending the Rule of Law &amp; Respecting Our Constitution</strong></p>
<p>When President Obama first announced his plan to unilaterally grant amnesty to five million illegal immigrants at the end of 2014, I publicly condemned it as outrageous and unconstitutional. After all, the president simply cannot re-write laws he does not like. Then as now, I considered it a direct challenge to our system of checks and balances that had to be opposed. As the year ended, Congress passed a budget that only funded the Department of Homeland Security – which handles immigration – for three months (until February 2015), by which point conservatives had majorities in both houses of Congress and a stronger position from which to stop the president’s unlawful order.</p>
<p>(Remember: President Obama himself <a href="https://www.speaker.gov/general/22-times-president-obama-said-he-couldn-t-ignore-or-create-his-own-immigration-law" target="_blank">publicly stated on at least 22 occasions</a> that he does not have the authority to act unilaterally on immigration.)</p>
<p>At the start of 2015, the House considered <a href="https://www.gop.gov/bill/h-r-240-department-of-homeland-security-appropriations-act-2015/">a Homeland Security appropriations bill</a> (H.R. 240) to fund most of the department through the rest of the fiscal year with <a href="https://www.gop.gov/bill/h-r-240-department-of-homeland-security-appropriations-act-2015/">five critical amendments</a> to properly defund the amnesty order and combat further illegal immigration. I was proud to support this bill with all five amendments. Unfortunately, the bill was changed in the Senate to fund the entire department (amnesty included) and sent back to the House. At that point, having pledged that the president’s breach of power could not be tolerated, I voted to prevent <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/240/actions">the new bill</a> from being considered, and then, after it still made its way to the floor, opposed its final passage. The way I saw it, I simply could not support committing taxpayer dollars to illegal activity. The rule of law had to be defended and our system of government had to be protected.</p>
<p>Another situation in which President Obama has attempted to bypass Congress with his agenda remains the implementation of <a href="https://unoda-web.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/English7.pdf">the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty</a> (ATT), which his administration signed in 2013 but has still not submitted to the Senate for ratification. The ATT is an outrageous agreement that would force the United States – the world’s most important defender of peace and democracy – onto equal footing with the world’s worst dictatorships and terror-sponsors. It can be easily politicized by bad actors to try to stop America from providing arms to our friends and allies, including Israel. Ominously, the treaty excludes any specific protection for the fundamental right of individuals to keep and bear arms, which only opens the door wider to domestic gun control impositions.</p>
<p>In March, as the new Congress was getting underway, I enlisted 34 freshman House members to co-sign <a href="https://kelly.house.gov/press-release/rep-kelly-enlists-house-freshmen-fight-stop-un-arms-trade-treaty">a joint letter from me to President Obama</a> explicitly declaring our unified opposition to the ATT and our commitment to denying any federal funding for the treaty’s implementation. (It was similar to <a href="/sites/kelly.house.gov/files/Kelly%20Member%20Letter%20to%20Obama%20on%20UN%20Arms%20Trade%20Treaty%20FINAL%2010-15-2013.pdf">a previous letter</a> that 180 of my colleagues had already co-signed back in 2013.) That same month, I contacted the chairmen of each relevant Appropriations subcommittee to ensure that a funding ban was included in each of their <a href="https://kelly.house.gov/press-release/rep-kelly-seeks-renew-funding-ban-un-arms-trade-treaty-fy-2016-appropriations-bills">respective appropriations bills</a> for the upcoming year (each of which eventually became law). Consequently, by the end of 2015, Congress had once again successfully prohibited any federal department or agency from funding the advancement of the ATT. In particular, <em>the National Defense Authorization Act for 2016</em> included <a href="https://kelly.house.gov/press-release/house-passes-national-defense-bill-kelly-amendment-ban-funding-un-arms-trade-treaty">the strongest version of my amendment to date</a>, which also bans funding for an ATT<br />
	“secretariat” to implement any portion of the treaty and prohibits the Defense Department from facilitating any domestic prosecutions of individual Americans as a potential result of the treaty.</p>
<p>The liberty of the American people and the sovereignty of the United States are far too sacred to ever be sacrificed at the altar of a dysfunctional global institution like the United Nations. For the sake of our freedom at home and our strength abroad, this fight must continue.</p>
<p>Speaking of the UN, while the ATT was effectively rendered void by Congress and taxpayer dollars were fully prevented from supporting it, the same regretfully cannot be said about the Obama administration’s <a href="https://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/more-details-about-the-agreement/">international agreement on climate change</a> recently finalized in Paris (also known as the Paris Protocol). A major part of this agreement is the creation of a “Green Climate Fund” to pay for clean-energy projects in developing countries, which is designed to be given $100 billion annually by all participating nations. President Obama has already pledged $3 billion of American taxpayer money to this fund.</p>
<p>In my strong opinion, the contents of this agreement clearly amount to a treaty and thus it must be submitted to the Senate for scrutiny, as required by Article 2, Section 2, Clause 2 of our Constitution. Appallingly, when the White House was asked about this requirement last March, the president’s spokesman scoffed at the very idea of giving Congress the “opportunity to render judgment.” With this sort of unlawful (but unsurprising) arrogance in mind, I joined Senator Mike Lee in introducing <a href="https://kelly.house.gov/press-release/rep-kelly-introduces-resolution-sen-lee-stop-obama-administration-circumventing">a concurrent resolution</a> in the House and Senate (H. Con. Res. 97 and S. Con. Res. 25) to stop President Obama from circumventing Congress with the Paris agreement and demand that it be properly sent to the Senate for its advice and consent. In early December, I hosted <a href="https://kelly.house.gov/press-release/icymi-rep-kelly-hosts-special-order-mandatory-congressional-oversight-paris-climate">a Special Order on the House floor</a> to bring attention to this entire situation. As of right now, my resolution has 74 co-sponsors in House while Sen. Lee’s has 33 in the Senate.</p>
<p>Whether the issue at hand is immigration, gun control, or climate change, I intend to continue opposing this president’s overreaches of power and reminding him as forcefully as necessary what every civic leader in America should already know: The Constitution is <em>not</em> a suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>Standing Up for Students, Families, Seniors, Veterans, and the Unborn</strong></p>
<p>Over the past 12 months, I was proud to seize numerous opportunities to support legislative action to help everyday Americans, especially the most vulnerable members of our society. The following is a list of significant legislation that I was proud to push forward in the People’s House last year:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://kelly.house.gov/press-release/rep-kelly-calls-passage-pain-capable-unborn-child-protection-act"><em>The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act</em></a><span> (H.R. 36), which would ban abortions from being performed beyond the 20th week of a pregnancy, when the unborn child is able to feel pain.</span></li>
